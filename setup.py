# To include other files, such as the static and templates directories, include_package_data is set. Python needs another file named MANIFEST.in to tell what this other data is.

# Nothing changes from how youâ€™ve been running your project so far. 
# FLASK_APP is still set to flaskr and flask run still runs the application, 
# but you can call it from anywhere, not just the flask-tutorial directory.
